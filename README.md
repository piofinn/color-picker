# Color

Color is a fullscreen color picker for the web, based on Vue.js and plain old Javascript. It lets you focus on the color you are picking rather than the color palette you are choosing from.

## Getting started

If you want to play around with the project on your own machine you can follow the instructions below to set up the dev environment in just a few minutes!

### Prerequisites

You will need a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. Follow the installation instructions on the Node.js site if you don't already have this installed.

### Installing

Download the project files or clone the github archive onto your machine (see the [GitHub help page](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) for instructions on setting up git on your machine)
